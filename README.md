# Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR)
The following research was conducted in 2022, focusing on Security orchestration, automation and response (SOAR) and its processes. The aim was to comprehend the fundamental concepts of this specific cybersecurity management process.

## SOAR Process
**Step One. Assessment and Planning** 
- Evaluate your organisation's current security infrastructure, including tools, processes, and personnel.
- Identify gaps and inefficiencies in incident response and security operations.
- Define your goals and objectives for implementing a SOAR solution.

**Step Two. Vendor Selection**
- Research and evaluate SOAR platforms from different vendors based on your organisation's requirements, budget, scalability, and integration capabilities.
- Consider factors such as automation capabilities, orchestration features, ease of integration with existing security tools, and support for regulatory compliance.

**Step Three. Integration**
- Integrate the selected SOAR platform with your existing security tools, such as SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), firewalls, endpoint protection, threat intelligence feeds, and ticketing systems.
- Ensure seamless communication and data sharing between different security tools and the SOAR platform to enable automated workflows and response actions.

**Step Four. Customization and Workflow Design**
- Customize the SOAR platform to align with your organization's specific security policies, procedures, and incident response workflows.
- Design automated playbooks and workflows for common security use cases, such as malware detection, phishing incidents, data breaches, and insider threats.
- Define escalation paths, decision trees, and response actions for different types of security incidents.

**Step Five. Training and Skill Development**
- Provide training to security analysts, incident responders, and other relevant staff on using the SOAR platform effectively.
- Educate teams on new processes, automation capabilities, and best practices for incident response and security operations.
- Foster collaboration and cross-functional teamwork among different teams involved in cybersecurity.

**Step Six. Testing and Optimization**
- Conduct thorough testing and validation of the SOAR platform and automated workflows in a controlled environment before deploying them in production.
- Monitor and analyze the performance of the SOAR platform, identify bottlenecks, and optimize workflows for efficiency and effectiveness.
- Continuously update and refine playbooks, response actions, and integrations based on lessons learned from real-world incidents and feedback from users.

**Step Seven. Deployment and Continuous Improvement**
- Deploy the SOAR platform in your production environment, gradually phasing in automation and orchestration capabilities as your team gains experience and confidence.
- Implement a feedback loop to gather input from users and stakeholders, track key performance indicators (KPIs), and measure the impact of the SOAR solution on security operations.
- Continuously improve and evolve your SOAR implementation based on evolving threats, changes in technology, and lessons learned from incident response activities.

# Research Material 
As the cybersecurity landscape becomes more intricate, Blue Teams are increasingly turning to innovative technologies to protect their organisations' digital infrastructure. Among these technologies, Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) has emerged as a valuable resource for Blue Teams in streamlining Incident Response (IR) processes and managing diverse security tools.

By harnessing SOAR technologies, Blue Teams can merge various tools into a single work queue or dashboard, offering them a centralised and comprehensive view of their security status. Additionally, deception technologies play a vital role in bolstering Blue Teams' capabilities. These technologies create authentic decoys and traps within the network to mislead and identify attackers, ultimately enabling faster detection and response to threats (McLaughlin, 2023).
